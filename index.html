      about me ✨
      <br /><br />
      Alexandria Ahluwalia recently completed MA coursework in the Internet
      Equalities course at UAL’s Creative Computing Institute. Her research
      focused on the critical study of data and digital technologies while
      incorporating disability, environmental, climate, and gender justice. Her
      creative practice critically re-imagined and speculated diverse futures of
      technology and society through various digital mediums and materials to
      encourage reflection on digital technologies. Previously, she collaborated
      with the Gender + Collective in the Office of Regional and International
      Community Engagement and co- created a Community-Based Research and Data
      Justice Resource Guide. Alexandria also holds a BSc in Mathematics from
      the University of British Columbia.

      tips (from what I enjoyed):<br /><br />
      - have fun with this project <br />
      - talk to others at the cci, get help from technical <br />
      - make the project for you, write the thesis/portfolio to explain <br />
      - pick a topic you are interested in (a topic you can lose track of
      time/go too deep on the internet reading about) 🍾<br />
    </div>

    <div>
      tips (from what I could have done differently):<br /><br />
      - don't leave anything to last minute <br />
      - don't stress yourself out too much 🌎<br />
    </div>

    <div>
      things I would tell myself 1 year ago:<br /><br />
      - start collecting references/citations now! and write with them <br />
      - be overly organized <br />
      - talk to others at the cci, get help from technical <br />
      - plan ahead time wise, but be ok with changing plans, write it all down
      <br />
      - take pictures and document process more 🍇<br />
